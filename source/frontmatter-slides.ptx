			Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) form a gateway course for many STEM majors, yet students often encounter steep conceptual and technical barriers when transitioning from calculus to differential equations. This talk presents a case study in rethinking ODE pedagogy through the development of an open-access textbook that blends student-centered narrative, scaffolded checkpoints, interactive technology, and structured workflows.
		</p>

		<p>
			The project's guiding question is: How can textbook design itself function as an innovation in teaching and learning? Each chapter is built around conversational explanations, step-by-step workflow and reading checkpoints that emphasize concepts and procedure. Interactive visualizations add a dynamic perspective to simulate a classroom experience.
		</p>

		<p>
			By framing the textbook not only as a resource but as a pedagogical experiment, this work highlights the role of curriculum design in shaping student experiences of ODEs and opens space for dialogue about how innovative resources can transform undergraduate mathematics education.
