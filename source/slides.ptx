			<title>Why Rethink the Differential Equations Textbook?</title>

			<p>
				Differential equations is a gateway course for many STEM majors, yet the materials we use are often
				expensive, static, and mismatched to how students actually learn today.
			</p>

			<ul pause="no">
				<li>Commercial texts are polished but rigid.</li>
				<li>Free notes exist, but often lack structure and support.</li>
				<li>Students increasingly expect interactive, accessible, and digital-first resources.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				This talk describes the design of a student-centered, interactive textbook and the tools that made it sustainable.

			<title>Part I: Authoring Tool</title>

			<p>
				PreTeXt is an open-source authoring system for writing structured, accessible, and interactive educational materials.
			</p>

			<dl pause="no">
				<li>
					<title>Write once, publish everywhere</title>
					<p>Web, PDF, ePub, large print, and Braille from a single source.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<title>Pedagogy-aware structure</title>
					<p>Examples, exercises, definitions, and loads of interactive features.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<title>Accessibility by design</title>
					<p>Screen-reader friendly, responsive layouts, and dark/light modes.</p>
				</li>
			</dl>

			<p>
				Whether you want an interactive textbook, a research hub, or lecture notes, PreTeXt is ready for most workflows.

			<p>
				The learning curve is real, but front-loaded, and well-supported by the community.

				Interactivity is optional, but when used intentionally, it changes how students read.

			<title>From Tool to Design</title>

			<p>
				Textbooks are typically written, reviewed, and evaluated by experts in the field.
				As a result, they often prioritize disciplinary completeness over how students
				actually experience the material.
			</p>

			<p>
				That tension led to our guiding design question:
			</p>

			<p>
				<em>What would a differential equations textbook look like if it were written entirely for students?</em>
			</p>

		</slide>

		<slide label="p2-design">
			<title>Part II: Textbook Design</title>

			<p>
				The answer was not a longer or more feature-rich textbook,
				but one intentionally designed around how students read,
				reflect, and build understanding.
			</p>

			<p>
				This led to a set of student-centered design principles:
			</p>

			<p>
				<line>🔸A conversational, instructor-like tone</line>
				<line>🔸Short, focused narrative blocks instead of long exposition</line>
				<line>🔸Low-stakes checkpoint questions to guide attention</line>
				<line>🔸Dynamic visualizations for conceptual clarity</line>
				<line>🔸Audio narration to support accessibility and review</line>
			</p>

			<p>
				No book will ever replace in-class, face-to-face instruction.
				The goal here was to bring as much of that instructional experience
				into the book as possible.

			<title>From Design to Evaluation</title>

			<p>
				The interactive features in this textbook were not added for novelty,
				but to address persistent challenges in how students learn differential equations.
			</p>

			<p>
				To move beyond anecdote, we will be conducting a formal study to examine 
				how students actually engage with these features and what they perceive
				as beneficial or challenging.
			</p>

			<p>
				This work is framed as a small mixed-methods pedagogical study and will be implemented this spring.
			</p>
		</slide>

		<slide label="p3-research-focus">
			<title>Part III: Pedagogical Evaluation</title>

			<p>
				The plan for the guiding research question is:
			</p>

			<p>
				<em>
					In what ways do interactive textbooks enhance students’ understanding
					of differential equations concepts?
				</em>
			</p>

			<p>
				Data will be collected through a student survey, and will be
				supplemented by open-ended and reflective focus groups.
			</p>

			<p>
				The emphasis will be on student engagement, conceptual understanding,
				persistence, and accessibility.
			</p>
		</slide>

		<slide label="p3-what-we-measure">
			<title>What We Are Measuring</title>

			<p>
				Rather than testing isolated skills, the study will examine how students
				<em>use</em> the textbook while learning.

				<ul pause="no">
					<li>How students engage with low-stakes reading questions</li>
					<li>Whether feedback prompts reflection and persistence</li>
					<li>Which interactive elements support or hinder learning</li>
					<li>How students rate the experience to traditional books</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				These measures are designed to connect textbook features directly
				to learning behaviors.
			</p>
		</slide>

		<slide label="p3-why-it-matters">
			<title>Why This Matters</title>

			<p>
				Differential equations is conceptually challenging because it asks students
				to reason about dynamic systems using static representations.
			</p>

			<p>
				Interactive textbooks have the potential to:
			</p>

			<ul pause="no">
				<li>Make abstract behavior more concrete and visual</li>
				<li>Encourage struggle through immediate feedback</li>
				<li>Support persistence when students answer incorrectly</li>
				<li>Improve accessibility through multimodal engagement</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				This study will help evaluate whether those potential benefits are realized in practice.

			<title>Closing Thoughts</title>

			<p>
				Open textbooks are not just about cost, they are about control, adaptability, and pedagogy.
			</p>

			<p>
				PreTeXt made it possible to build something ambitious and to keep improving it over time.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you ever thought about writing a book you wish existed, the tools are ready.
