			<title>Why Rethink the Differential Equations Textbook?</title>

			<p>
				Differential equations is a gateway course for many STEM majors, yet the materials we use are often
				expensive, static, and mismatched to how students actually learn today.
			</p>

			<ul pause="no">
				<li>Commercial texts are polished but rigid.</li>
				<li>Free notes exist, but often lack structure and support.</li>
				<li>Students increasingly expect interactive, accessible, and digital-first resources.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				This talk describes the design of a student-centered, interactive textbook and the tools that made it sustainable.

			<title>Part I: What Is PreTeXt?</title>

			<p>
				PreTeXt is an open-source authoring system for writing structured, accessible, and interactive educational materials.
			</p>

			<dl pause="no">
				<li>
					<title>Write once, publish everywhere</title>
					<p>Web, PDF, ePub, large print, and Braille from a single source.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<title>Pedagogy-aware structure</title>
					<p>Examples, exercises, definitions, and loads of interactive features.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<title>Accessibility by design</title>
					<p>Screen-reader friendly, responsive layouts, and dark/light modes.</p>
				</li>
			</dl>

			<p>
				Whether you want an interactive textbook, an research hub, or lecture notes, PreTeXt is ready for most workflows.

			<p>
				The learning curve is real, but front-loaded, and well-supported by the community.

			<title>Part II: From Tool to Textbook</title>

			<p>
				Rather than starting with features, I started with a question:
			</p>

			<p>
				<em>What would a differential equations textbook look like if it were written entirely for students?</em>
			</p>

		<slide label="p2-design">
			<title>Part II: Student-Centered Design Principles</title>

			<p>
				<line>🔸Conversational, instructor-like tone</line>
				<line>🔸Short narrative blocks—no walls of text</line>
				<line>🔸Frequent, low-stakes reflection points</line>
				<line>🔸low buy-in reading questions </line>
				<line>🔸Interative Visualizations for dynamic instruction</line>
				<line>🔸Audio narration for accessibility</line>
			</p>

			<p>
				The goal is not more interaction, but better-timed interaction.

			<ul pause="no">
				<li>Processing of student data via hosting platforms, like Runestone Academy.</li>
				<li>Students regularly used reading questions as navigation cues.</li>
				<li>Audio narration supported accessibility and review.</li>
				<li>Interactive visuals reduced reliance on office hours for conceptual issues.</li>
			</ul>

				Ongoing survey and focus group data are informing future revisions.

			<title>Closing Thoughts</title>

			<p>
				Open textbooks are not just about cost, they are about control, adaptability, and pedagogy.
			</p>

			<p>
				PreTeXt made it possible to build something ambitious as a solo author and to keep improving it over time.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you have ever wanted to write the book you wish you had, the tools are ready.
