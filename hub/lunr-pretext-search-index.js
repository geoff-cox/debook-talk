  "body": "  Dr. Geoff Cox 🔹 Dr. Blain Patterson Applied Mathematics @ Virginia Military Institute  Presentation Hub        Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) form a gateway course for many STEM majors, yet students often encounter steep conceptual and technical barriers when transitioning from calculus to differential equations. This talk presents a case study in rethinking ODE pedagogy through the development of an open-access textbook that blends student-centered narrative, scaffolded checkpoints, interactive technology, and structured workflows.  The project's guiding question is: How can textbook design itself function as an innovation in teaching and learning? Each chapter is built around conversational explanations, step-by-step workflow and reading checkpoints that emphasize concepts and procedure. Interactive visualizations add a dynamic perspective to simulate a classroom experience.  By framing the textbook not only as a resource but as a pedagogical experiment, this work highlights the role of curriculum design in shaping student experiences of ODEs and opens space for dialogue about how innovative resources can transform undergraduate mathematics education.

  "title": "PreTeXt Setup Guide",
  "body": " PreTeXt Setup Guide   Workspace Setup  The quickest and easiest way to get started with PreTeXt is through GitHub. Using a GitHub Codespace means you don't need to install anything locally — everything runs in your browser with all dependencies preconfigured. Here's how to set it up:     Create a GitHub Account    Go to GitHub .  Create an account (it's free for individual users).      Import the PreTeXt Codespace Template    Visit the official PreTeXt Codespace repository on GitHub.     Click    and choose    Create a New Repository .    In the new window, fill in:  Repository name  Description — optional.  Visibility — choose Public or Private .  Then click Create repository . GitHub will copy the official PreTeXt codespace into your account as a new repo.       Start Your Codespace    If you weren't automatically redirected, go to your GitHub account and open the new repository you just created.     Click    and open the Codespaces tab.         In this tab, click       The Codespace will begin setting up. This may take a few minutes the first time. When complete, you'll have a fully functional PreTeXt workspace running in your browser.         A Minimal Project   Once your Codespace loads, it'll will look like so:   It's ready for PreTeXt , but it needs a few files first. If you click on the README.md and scroll down to Creating a New Project , you'll find some directions for initiating a PreTeXt project.    Creating a New Book     Creating a New PreTeXt Project    Hit F1 to open the command palette.  Type pretext .  Scroll down and select PreTeXt : New Project .  Select the type of document you want to create. For this demo, we'll choose book .  Select the location of your project, but the default should be the one you want.       Completing these steps will populate your codespace with all the files you need to author in PreTeXt . In fact, it also provides a template that build right-away.     Your First Build     Building A PreTeXt Book     Locate the ▷ PreTeXt button on the bottom tool bar.      To build the book, select Build default target .  The default is the html version of the book. Let's also build a pdf version of the book as well.  Click on the ▷ PreTeXt button and select Build Another Target followed by the print option.  The results of both of these builds should now be in the output folder.         Viewing the Output     Viewing A PreTeXt Book    Now, we can view both the html and pdf version of the template book.  To view them, click on the ▷ PreTeXt button again and select View Full Document then choose either the web or print option.  In either case, a new broswer window should open. If the html doesn't display in the broswer, try refreshing the page.          Having A Look Around  Once your Codespace loads, you'll see a ready-to-use PreTeXt project folder. You could begin writing immediately, but before doing so it's helpful to understand the structure and purpose of the key folders and files.   Notable Folders & Files     source  This folder contains your PreTeXt document files. Typically separated by chapter or section, plus a main.ptx file, which pulls them together.    output  The output folder is automatically generated when you build your project and contains the final product, ready to view or publish. You don't edit anything here.    assets  A general-purpose folder for supporting materials like images, data files, videos, etc. When you reference these in your source, PreTeXt includes them automatically.        project.ptx  The central configuration file that describes your entire project. This is where you specify the formats you want to generate and what files are needed to build them.    main.ptx  The entry point of your PreTeXt document that ties together all chapters or sections. It's like the table of contents of your project.    publication.ptx  This settings file that contains all the visual knobs for customizing the output of your documents.       "

  "body": " Student Feedback Survey   Purpose and Consent  This survey gathers feedback on your experience using an interactive differential equations textbook. The goal is to understand how interactive reading questions and other features influence student learning and engagement.  Your participation is completely voluntary.
